               <xhtml:p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Health Level Seven (HL7) Reference Information Model (RIM) is a static model of health and health care information as viewed within the scope of HL7 standards development activities. It is the combined consensus view of information from the perspective of the HL7 working group and the HL7 international affiliates. The RIM is the ultimate source from which all HL7 version 3.0 protocol specification standards draw their information-related content.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="History of the RIM">
                  <xhtml:p>Development of the HL7 RIM began in April 1996. The first release of the RIM was adopted by the HL7 Technical Steering Committee at the January 1997 working group meeting. This release was known as the HL7 draft RIM version 0.80.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The next two working group meetings focused on gaining familiarity with the draft RIM and implementing a process for obtaining and reconciling proposed enhancements to the model. The RIM maintenance process became known as "RIM harmonization." Between 1998 and 2000, there were nine harmonization meetings to consider proposed enhancements to the draft RIM. The meetings culminated in version 1.0 of the HL7 RIM, unveiled at the HL7 working group meeting held in January 2001. The harmonization meetings focused on five major themes:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:b>Ensure coverage of HL7 version 2.x.</xhtml:b> This set of change proposals introduced content to the draft model to ensure that it included all the information content of HL7 version 2.x.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:b>Remove unsubstantiated content from the model.</xhtml:b> This set of change proposals focused on removing content from the draft model that the steward technical committee did not originate and could find no rationale for retaining.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:b>Unified service action model.</xhtml:b> This set of change proposals introduced a concise, well-defined set of structures and vocabularies that address the information needs of a wide variety of clinical scenarios. This collection of proposals, know as USAM, involved the combined effort of multiple technical committees.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:b>Ensure quality.</xhtml:b> This set of change proposals addressed inconsistencies in the draft model and conflicts between the model and the modeling style guide. It began the practice of recording and tracking open issues in the model.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:b>Address the "left hand side" of the model.</xhtml:b> This set of change proposals introduced powerful structures and vocabularies for the non-clinical portions of the model (patient administration, finance, scheduling). Like the unified service action model, this proposal involved the combined effort of multiple technical committees.</xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:p>The harmonization process and themes have produced an HL7 reference information model that is credible, clear, comprehensive, concise, and consistent. Its structure is both flexible and extensible, and its contents can be readily mapped to the HL7 2.x message standard and other widely used healthcare dataset specifications.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>This ballot is release 1.22 of the HL7 RIM. It is a model that continues to be fine tuned as technical committees use it for an ever widening scope of work as part of developing a family of HL7 model-driven standards, HL7 version 3.0. The RIM is now remarkably stable and at the same time the harmonization process ensures it will always be relevant and reflective of the information needs of the HL7 standards. </xhtml:p>
               </xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="Use of the RIM by HL7">
                  <xhtml:p>The HL7 RIM is a critical component of the V3 development process. It is the root of all information models and structures developed as part of the V3 development process.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The HL7 V3 standard development process is a model-driven methodology in which a network of inter-related models are developed that depict the static and behavioral aspects of the requirements and design of HL7 standards, as well as the underlying semantics and business rules that govern them.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The RIM provides a static view of the information needs of HL7 V3 standards. It includes class and state-machine diagrams and is accompanied by use case models, interaction models, data type models, terminology models, and other types of models to provide a complete view of the requirements and design of HL7 standards. The classes, attributes, state-machines, and relationships in the RIM are used to derive domain-specific information models that are then transformed through a series of constraining refinement processes to eventually yield a static model of the information content of an HL7 standard.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The HL7 V3 standard development process defines the rules governing the derivation of domain information models from the RIM and the refinement of those models into HL7 standard specifications. The rules require that all information structures in derived models be traceable back to the RIM and that their semantic and related business rules not conflict with those specified in the RIM. The RIM therefore is the ultimate source for all information content in HL7 V3 standards.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The RIM is used by HL7 international affiliates to extend HL7 V3 standards to meet local needs. Through a process known as localization, V3 standard specifications are extended using the RIM as the source for new information content. This new information is derived from the RIM and refined in the same manner used to create the original specification.</xhtml:p>
               </xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="Uses of the RIM Outside of HL7">
                  <xhtml:p>The RIM is primarily for use by HL7 and its international affiliates. However, others outside of HL7 have also found the RIM useful. Early adopters of the V3 standards development process have used the RIM to develop HL7-like message specifications in their own environments. These early adopters include vendors, large integrated delivery networks, and government agencies within the United States and internationally. These same early adopters are extremely active in HL7 and provide practical input to the RIM and other aspects of V3 the development process.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Some HL7 member organizations have reported using the RIM as a source of input to their enterprise information architectures or as a starting place for systems analysis and design. The RIM may indeed be useful for such purposes; however, HL7 provides no assurance that the RIM is useful for anything other than as a reference model for HL7 standards development.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The RIM is only one model of healthcare information needs. The abstract style of the RIM and the ability to extend the RIM through vocabulary specifications make the RIM applicable to any conceivable healthcare system information interchange scenario. In fact, it is conceptually applicable to any information domain involving entities playing roles and participating in acts.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The universal applicability of the RIM makes it particularly useful for an organization like HL7 that has to consider the needs of a large and diverse membership. The style of the RIM makes it extremely stable, which is another important characteristic for HL7. The HL7 standards development process calls for the creation of domain specific models derived from the RIM and the incremental refinement of those models into design models that are specific to the problem area. These problem area specific design models narrow the abstractness of the RIM and include constraints on attribute values and class relationships that are use case specific. External organizations considering using the HL7 RIM are advised to adopt a similar process of deriving design models as a transformation of the RIM.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RIM uses a very abstract modeling style. The back-bone classes of the RIM and their structural attributes are its core. An understanding of these classes and attributes are essential to understanding the RIM.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>The RIM is comprised of six "back-bone" classes:</xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:object name="classRef">

                        </xhtml:object> which represents the binding of one act to another, such as the relationship between an order for an observation and the observation event as it occurs; and</xhtml:li>

                  <xhtml:p>Three of these classes -- Act, Entity and Role -- are further represented by a set of specialized classes, or sub-types. In the HL7 representation, a sub-type is only added to the RIM if it requires one or more attributes or associations that are not inherited from its parents. Classes that represent distinct concepts, but which need no further attributes or associations are represented solely as a unique code in the controlling vocabulary. Therefore, these three classes include the following coded attributes, which serve to further define the concept being modeled:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:b>classCode </xhtml:b>(in Act, Entity and Role) represents the exact class or concept intended, whether or not that class is represented as a class in the RIM hierarchy;</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:b>moodCode </xhtml:b>(in Act) and <xhtml:b>determinerCode </xhtml:b>(in Entity) an attribute that distinguishes whether the class represents an instance or a kind of Act or Entity. If the class is a specialization of Act then moodCode further delineates the instance as an occurrence or an intent;</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:b>code </xhtml:b>(in Act, Entity and Role) provides for further classification within a particular classCode value, such as a particular type of observation within the Observation class. </xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:p>The other three RIM back-bone classes -- Participation, ActRelationship and RoleLink -- are not represented by generalization-specialization hierarchies. Nevertheless, these classes represent a variety of concepts, such as different forms of participation or different kinds of relationships between acts. These distinctions are represented by a <xhtml:b>typeCode </xhtml:b>attribute that is asserted for each of these classes.</xhtml:p>
               </xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
                          title="Representation of RIM class structure">
                  <xhtml:p>As noted previously, the RIM is modeled using a subset of the semantics embodied in UML. The RIM is a set of UML classes, each containing one or more attributes, which are assigned a data type based on an independent specification of Version 3 data types. The classes are linked either by a set of association relationships, identified by unique role names, or by generalization relationships.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Each of these elements includes a textual definition. The appearance of attributes and associations is controlled by cardinality and related constraints applied to the attributes and to the roles that link the associations to the classes. </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Several of the attributes in the RIM are coded with the CS data type, which means that the value set to be used for those attributes must be drawn from the set of codes that have been defined by HL7. The classCode and typeCode attributes mentioned above are examples of attributes with a CS data type.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>All of the code sets for these attributes are included as part of this ballot and are subject to the same voting principles as the classes in the RIM. Each code set is represented as a vocabulary domain -- the set of all concepts that can be taken as valid values in an instance of a coded field or attribute. It is important to note that a vocabulary domain consists of a set of concepts, not a set of words or codes.</xhtml:p>

            <mif:text>
               <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="Purpose">
                  <xhtml:p>This document is meant to serve as an "Executive Summary" of the basic concepts and rationale behind the design and development of the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM). It is not meant to be an "application guide" on RIM usage although several partial examples of usage are presented when they are deemed helpful in explaining the fundamental design and development concepts of the RIM.</xhtml:p>
               </xhtml:div>
               <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="Overview">
                  <xhtml:p>A Reference Information Model (RIM) is constructed to facilitate consistent sharing and usage of data across multiple "local" contexts. In general, the broader the scope of interest, the more important it is to make explicit all assumptions about a topic or domain-of-interest. The HL7 Version 3 RIM is designed to provide a unified framework for, and to serve as a comprehensive source of, all information used by an HL7 Specification. The RIM specifically and unambiguously articulates both the explicit definitions of healthcare concepts - the "things of interest" to the world of healthcare information systems - and the relationships (aka "associations") between these concepts-of-interest.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>HL7 V3 Specifications (e.g. HL7 V3 messages, structured documents, etc.) permit loosely-coupled information systems to interoperate (i.e. exchange data) in a variety of healthcare delivery contexts including those found in disparate provider organizations, perspectives, and jurisdictions. The scope of the HL7 RIM therefore includes all of the information that is required to be sent between, and processed by, participating healthcare information systems. In addition, it should be noted that the RIM does not model (nor need to model) information stored by a given healthcare information system but never transmitted to another system. </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The RIM is expressed using a visual modeling syntax based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). (Specific variances between "standard UML" and "HL7 UML" as manifest in the RIM, such as the placement of association names, are currently under review by the HL7 Modeling and Methodology Technical Committee with the goal of moving to a maximum alignment between the two syntaxes.) HL7 also maintains a database ("RIM repository") containing the details of each RIM concept, attribute, and association including the item's rationale, definition, constraints, and edit/change history. At some point in the future, any or all of this information may be formally published in an HL7-specific UML profile. </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>It is important to note that the RIM is not intended to be a logical or physical model of a database, a design for a particular vendor's information system, or a perspective focused on a particular healthcare organization or enterprise. In fact, the RIM is not intended to represent a particular set of HL7 messages, but rather the collective universe of data and relationships from which any relevant HL7 message could be constructed. Specific users of the RIM are expected to utilize relevant portions of the RIM as needed, adopting its content to their own information modeling needs and notations. </xhtml:p>

                          title="The Rationale Behind the RIM's Design">
                  <xhtml:p>The overarching structure of the RIM is based on six "core" classes: Act, Entity, Role, Participation, ActRelationship, and RoleLink. Each class is defined in Section 1.4. Following is a discussion of the fundamental thinking behind, and basic usage guidelines for, the six classes and their inter-relationships.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The HL7 RIM identifies two major "high-level" concepts that are fundamental to understanding the world of healthcare information: intentional "actions" or "services" (Acts), and "people, places and things" that are of interest in the world of healthcare (Entities).</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The concept "Act" (and its subclasses) represents all of the intentional actions documented by a healthcare professional in either a clinical or administrative context. The presence of the Act class as one of the core RIM classes is a reflection of HL7's view that "from a messaging/system communication perspective, healthcare consists of a series of attributed, intentional actions. Thus, instances of the class/concept Act include both clinical observations (e.g. patient temperature) and interventions (e.g. administer medication), and administrative actions (e.g. admit patient). Note that in this "act-centered" view of healthcare, the act of an observation takes on two seemingly contradictory meanings: "the act of recognizing and documenting a particular fact," and "the description of the thing observed." In other words, an instance of an Observation Act represents both the attributed act of observing and the results of the observation. Both aspects of this expanded definition of an Observation Act are captured by specific attributes of the class Act or its subclass Observation.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The concept "Entity" (and its subclasses) includes all living subjects (e.g. persons, animals), organizations (e.g. formal and informal), materials (e.g. durable and non-durable goods, food, tissue, containers,), and places that may be of interest in a healthcare messaging context. It should be noted that the concept of "collection of information" (e.g. a medical record) is <xhtml:b>not </xhtml:b> a instance or subclass of Entity, but is instead considered as a collection of attributed Acts.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The RIM places two additional classes - Role and Participation - between Act and Entity. The Role class models several important concepts that are prevalent in the healthcare delivery domain. First, Role captures the fact that the various "static" entities may "temporally" assume one or more "roles" (e.g. patient, primary care physician, responsible party, Registered Nurse etc.) in a particular healthcare context. Second, the concepts of "capability" (e.g. Advanced Cardiac Life Support) and "certification" (e.g. Licensed Practical Nurse) are also modeled using instances of the Role class. Finally, careful examination of the multiplicity (0..1) and names (scoper, player) of the <xhtml:b>two</xhtml:b> associations between Entity and Role reveals that the Role class can be used to "group" instances of Entity.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>It is important to distinguish the concept of Entity-in-a-Role from the Act-specific concept of "the function-based role played by an Entity-in-a-Role in the context of a specific Act." These semantics are modeled using instances of the Participation class. For example, an Anesthesia Resident (Entity-in-a-Role) administers anesthesia (Participation as "provider" in the Act "administer anesthesia") to a patient (Participation as a 'recipient" in the Act "administer anesthesia." <xhtml:b>Note that the absence of a direct association between the Participation and Entity classes is a manifestation of an underlying HL7 RIM assumption that all instances of Entity involved in an Act are participating in the Act in a particular Role.</xhtml:b>
                  </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>In summary, both the Participation and the Role classes are necessary to fully model the complex semantics that exist between instances of Entity and Act, and a concise summary of the HL7 RIM's view of healthcare can be stated as follows: <xhtml:b>At the highest level of abstraction, healthcare consists of a series of intentional, attributed Acts performed to, by, on behalf of, utilizing or in some way involving one or more instances of a Participating ("as primary provider," etc.) Entity-in-a-Role ("John Smith in the role of Patient"). </xhtml:b>
                  </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The two remaining classes in the RIM - ActRelationship and RoleLink - are used to "associate" or "link" instances of the class with which it is associated. The class RoleLink is used to establish a "dependency-based link" (e.g. accountability, chain-of-trust, etc.) between <xhtml:b>two </xhtml:b>instances of an Entity-in-a-Role. The semantics of ActRelationship are explained below.</xhtml:p>

                          title="Linking Acts Together: The Semantics of ActRelationship">
                  <xhtml:p>An understanding of the semantics and application of ActRelationship begins with, an understanding of the "fractal" or "robotic arm" nature of a set of Acts. This perspective is, in turn, best viewed from the overarching framework of the categorization of three types of "collecting relationships" represented by instances of ActRelationship: whole/part (e.g. lab or test batteries (see the discussion of the "robotic arm" below); rule-based (e.g. care plans, protocols, etc.); and cognitive actions (e.g. judgment, renaming, replacement, subsumption, supported by/reason for, etc.).</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Regarding the "fractal" or "robotic arm" discussion, As mentioned above, instances of ActRelationship can be used to model the "fractal" or "robotic arm" notion behind a "whole/part" relationship. Consider a surgical procedure such as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The procedure may be represented as a single instance of Act, or, alternatively, as a "collection" of (partially ordered) instances of Act each of which is a finer granularity than the entire procedure, e.g. obtain consent, administer pre-op medication, administer anesthesia (throughout the surgical procedure), make the incision, etc. In turn, for any of the more finely granulated actions just mentioned, further granulation/decomposition may occur. The degree of granularity is clearly dependent on the context of the action(s) and the interest level/perspective of the party performing (or not performing) the decomposition. Figure 1 shows a "surgeon's-eye view" of some of the instances of Act and ActRelationship for the exemplar cholecystectomy..</xhtml:p>

                  </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>In summary, the classes Act and ActRelationship have been designed to allow for representing the rich semantics of each of three types of collections mentioned above at whatever coarseness or fineness of granularity is appropriate to the specific messaging context. In addition, the various of types of collections and levels of granularity represented by instances of ActRelationship can (and will) be expected to be used to collectively capture the complex semantics of clinical reasoning, e.g. an instance of ActRelationship (e.g. "supported by") could be used to form a link from an instance of an observation Act representing a specific lab test (e.g. sedimentation rate = 48 to an instance of an observation Act representing a particular diagnosis (e.g. DX = Systemic Lupus Erythematosus).</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>Entity, Act and Role are "high-level" classes, although they are not "abstract" classes in the formal sense (i.e. meaningful instances of both classes are quite common). As a result, it has been necessary to define a number of more specialized subclasses of these three classes to specify the additional data (class attributes) required in more specific contexts (e.g. the Observation subclass of Act and the Living Subject and Material subclasses of Entity). Attributes of a subclass must be both useful and unique to that subclass. Subclasses inherit all of the attributes of their parent superclass.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p>There are meaningful subclasses in each of these hierarchies that do not require additional attributes, and therefore are not represented as classes in the RIM. The "classCode" attribute in each of these hierarchies specifies which class is represented. The code set that can be used with the "classCode" attributes are tightly controlled by HL7. A second attribute in each hierarchy, the "code" attribute provides a further classification of subtypes of each subclass.</xhtml:p>
                  </xhtml:div>
                  <xhtml:div title="The Concept of Mood">
                     <xhtml:p>The Act class represents intentional actions. These actions can exist in different "moods". Moods describe activities as they progress in the business cycle, from defined, through planned and ordered to complete. The mood of an Act is specified by the value of the Act.moodCode attribute.</xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:p> Any instance of an Act assumes one and only one mood and will not change its mood along its life cycle. The moods - definition, intent, order, event - seem to specify a life cycle of an activity. However, the participants in the activity in these different moods are different, as is the data. Therefore, the mood of an Act instance is static. The progression actualization (i.e., the progression from defined, through planned and ordered, to being performed) is called the "business cycle" to distinguish it from the "life cycle" of a single act instance. Related Act instances that form such a "business cycle" are linked through the ActRelationship class. </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>The RIM class, attribute and association definitions provide detail about logical meaning, but a full specification requires data type and vocabulary specifications. <xhtml:b>Data Types</xhtml:b> define the allowable values of attributes and what these values "mean." Data types are therefore the fundamental building blocks that shape (and constrain) all the semantics that can ultimately expressed in the RIM. For HL7 Version 3, the datatype specifications are found in the <xhtml:a href="http://datatypes.htm#">Data Types Abstract Specification</xhtml:a> and in the <xhtml:a href="http://datatypes-its-xml.htm#">V3 Data Types Implementable Technology Specification for XML</xhtml:a> A summary of the data types is also provided in Appendix B.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Vocabulary specifications for attributes include the assignment of a default domain, and a "coding strength." <xhtml:b>Vocabulary Domains</xhtml:b> are explicitly defined in <xhtml:a href="http://vocabulary.htm#">Vocabulary Domains</xhtml:a>.

                     <xhtml:b>Coding strength</xhtml:b> is a coded property of an attribute that states whether or not a user of the HL7 Version 3 standard may communicate a coded value that is not part of the defined domain. Such a value is termed an "exception" to the domain. Coding strength may have one of two values. <xhtml:b>Coded with Exceptions (CWE) </xhtml:b> allows the end user to send a term from a local coding system in place of a term from the formal domain. <xhtml:b>Coded , No Exceptions (CNE) </xhtml:b> states that communication instances may only contain codes that are in the domain that constrains the attribute.</xhtml:p>

A direct outgrowth of this knowledge explication exercise is the ability to reuse the same concept in multiple healthcare messages. The complete process of defining a message is defined and discussed in the V3 Guide and accompanying HL7 Message Definition Framework (MDF). The basic steps include definition and documentation of the data interchange needs (e.g. a set of messages to support a particular clinical or administrative process) via a Storyboard, the selection/restriction of the RIM to those classes and attributes needed to populate the given message, and the subsequent application of additional constraints on number and possible values of each attribute. </xhtml:p>

A concept descriptor can contain the original text or phrase that served as the basis of the coding and one or more translations into different coding systems. A concept descriptor can also contain qualifiers to describe, e.g., the concept of a "left foot" as a postcoordinated term built from the primary code "FOOT" and the qualifier "LEFT". In exceptional cases, the concept descriptor need not contain a code but only the original text describing that concept. </xhtml:td>

         <mif:otherAnnotation type="Implications of Balloting the RIM">
            <mif:text>
               <xhtml:p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Balloting the RIM establishes it as more than just an internal HL7 artifact. As a balloted standard the RIM will be advanced as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard and perhaps as an ISO standard. Other ANSI or ISO accredited standards organizations such as X12 and CEN-TC251 (European Standardization of Health Informatics) have expressed interest in using or referencing the RIM in their own standards development work. Establishing the RIM as a standard makes its use by other standards development organizations (SDO) much easier. The potential for tremendous benefits exists by having a common reference information model used across multiple healthcare SDOs.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A balloted RIM is also important to meet the local standards needs of HL7 International Affiliates. In order for the affiliates to apply localized extensions to HL7 standards according to the HL7 V3 standard development process, the RIM itself must be a standard. This is often mandated by local geopolitical jurisdictions, e.g., to ensure that local standards are extensions of already approved general standards.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Federal, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States are encouraged to consider accredited national standards when conducting initiatives in which the standards are applicable. As a standard for information content of HL7 interoperability standards, U.S. governmental agencies will need to consider the applicability of the RIM when establishing health care systems interoperability solutions.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="Normative Portions of the RIM">
                  <xhtml:p>The RIM consists of classes assigned to one or more subject area packages. Attributes, Relationships, and State Machines are associated with classes. Only the classes included in the NormativeContent subject area and their associated attributes, relationships, and state machines are normative. Relationships between normative and non-normative classes are non-normative.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The RIM is expressed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) with HL7 specific tags as extensions to the UML model element metadata. All standard UML model element metadata values are normative but only the following HL7 extensions are also normative:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>Class.stateAttribute</xhtml:li>

                  </xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:p>The remaining HL7 extensions are for administrative use only and are not part of the normative RIM specification.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>The V3 Data type specifications (<xhtml:a href="http://datatypes.htm#">Data Types Abstract Specification</xhtml:a> and <xhtml:a href="http://datatypes-its-xml.htm#">V3 Data Types Implementable Technology Specification for XML</xhtml:a>) are related normative standards that are balloted independent of the RIM. The <xhtml:a href="http://vocabulary.htm#">HL7 Vocabulary Domain</xhtml:a> specification is an informative reference that includes a variety of tables and terminology references that are cited as domains by various RIM attributes. The vocabulary specifications for what are termed "structural attributes" are part of the normative RIM ballot because they are fundamental to the proper representation of health information using the RIM. A list of these normative tables and hyperlinks to them are provided <xhtml:a href="#div_sbj-rimdiv">at the end of this introduction</xhtml:a>.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>The normative portions of the RIM are the only portions subject to ballot and are the only portions for which conformance rules are defined.

                  <mif:text>   The kinds of acts that are common in health care are (1) a clinical observation, (2) an assessment of health condition (such as problems and diagnoses), (3) healthcare goals, (4) treatment services (such as medication, surgery, physical and psychological therapy), (5) assisting, monitoring or attending, (6) training and education services to patients and their next of kin, (7) and notary services (such as advanced directives or living will), (8) editing and maintaining documents, and many others.  Discussion and Rationale: Acts are the pivot of the RIM; all domain information and processes are represented primarily in Acts. Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional and occasionally non-intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an action.Acts connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations and connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations are the authors, performers and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (which includes tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes between Acts that are meant as factual records, vs. records of intended or ordered services, and the other modalities in which act can appear.One of the Participations that all acts have (at least implicitly) is a primary author, who is responsible of the Act and who "owns" the act. Responsibility for the act means responsibility for what is being stated in the Act and as what it is stated. Ownership of the act is assumed in the sense of who may operationally modify the same act. Ownership and responsibility of the Act is not the same as ownership or responsibility of what the Act-object refers to in the real world. The same real world activity can be described by two people, each being the author of their Act, describing the same real world activity. Yet one can be a witness while the other can be a principal performer. The performer has responsibilities for the physical actions; the witness only has responsibility for making a true statement to the best of his or her ability. The two Act-instances may even disagree, but because each is properly attributed to its author, such disagreements can exist side by side and left to arbitration by a recipient of these Act-instances.In this sense, an Act-instance represents a "statement" according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) [Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.] Rector and Nowlan have emphasized the importance of understanding the medical record not as a collection of facts, but "a faithful record of what clinicians have heard, seen, thought, and done." Rector and Nowlan go on saying that "the other requirements for a medical record, e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view." Indeed the Act class is this attributable statement, and the rules of updating acts (discussed in the state-transition model, see Act.statusCode) versus generating new Act-instances are designed according to this principle of permanent attributable statements.Rector and Nolan focus on the electronic medical record as a collection of statements, while attributed statements, these are still mostly factual statements. However, the Act class goes beyond this limitation to attributed factual statements, representing what is known as "speech-acts" in linguistics and philosophy. The notion of speech-act includes that there is pragmatic meaning in language utterances, aside from just factual statements; and that these utterances interact with the real world to change the state of affairs, even directly cause physical activities to happen. For example, an order is a speech act that (provided it is issued adequately) will cause the ordered action to be physically performed. The speech act theory has culminated in the seminal work by Austin (1962) [How to do things with words. Oxford University Press].An activity in the real world may progress from defined, through planned and ordered to executed, which is represented as the mood of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing from planned to executed, this progression is reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood that will not change along the Act-instance's life cycle. This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is often critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow comparing actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category "sequel").Act as statements or speech-acts are the only representation of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through a combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent "objective state of affairs" or "real processes" independent from attributed statements. As such, there is no distinction between an activity and its documentation. Every Act includes both to varying degrees. For example, a factual statement made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, is commonly known as a procedure report or original documentation (e.g., surgical procedure report, clinic note etc.). Conversely, a status update on an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer) is considered to capture that activity (and is later superceded by a full procedure report). However, both status update and procedure report are acts of the same kind, only distinguished by mood and state (see statusCode) and completeness of the information.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>A code distinguishing whether an Act is conceived of as a factual statement or in some other manner as a command, possibility, goal, etc.  Constraints: An Act-instance must have one and only one moodCode value.The moodCode of a single Act-instance never changes. Mood is not state.To describe the progression of a business activity from defined to planned to executed, etc. one must instantiate different Act-instances in the different moods and link them using ActRelationship of general type "sequel". (See ActRelationship.typeCode.)  Discussion: The Act.moodCode includes the following notions: (1) event, i.e., factual description of an actions that occurred; (2) definition of possible actions and action plans (the master file layer); (3) intent, i.e., an action plan instantiated for a patient as a care plan or order; (4) goal, i.e., an desired outcome attached to patient problems and plans; and (5) criterion, i.e., a predicate used to evaluate a logical expression.The Act.moodCode modifies the meaning of the Act class in a controlled way, just as in natural language, grammatical form of a verb modify the meaning of a sentence in defined ways. For example, if the mood is factual (event), then the entire act object represents a known fact. If the mood expresses a plan (intent), the entire act object represents the expectation of what should be done. The mood does not change the meaning of individual act properties in peculiar ways.Since the mood code is a determining factor for the meaning of an entire Act object, the mood must always be known. This means, whenever an act object is instantiated, the mood attribute must be assigned to a valid code, and the mood assignment cannot change throughout the lifetime of an act object.As the meaning of an act object is factored in the mood code, the mood code affects the interpretation of the entire Act object and with it every property (attributes and associations). Note that the mood code affects the interpretation of the act object, and the meaning of the act object in turn determines the meaning of the attributes. However, the mood code does not arbitrarily change the meaning of individual attributes.  Inert vs. descriptive properties of Acts: Acts have two kinds of act properties, inert and descriptive properties. Inert properties are not affected by the mood, descriptive properties follow the mood of the object. For example, there is an identifier attribute Act.id, which gives a unique identification to an act object. Being a unique identifier for the object is in no way dependent on the mood of the act object. Therefore, the "interpretation" of the Act.id attribute is inert with respect to the act object's mood.By contrast, most of the Act class' attributes are descriptive for what the Act statement expresses. Descriptive properties of the Act class give answer to the questions who, whom, where, with what, how and when the action is done. The questions who, whom, with what, and where are answered by Participations, while how and when are answered by descriptive attributes and ActRelationships. The interpretation of a descriptive attribute is aligned to the interpretation of the entire act object, and controlled by the mood. </mif:text>

                     <mif:text>   The notion of "mood" is borrowed from natural language grammar, the mood of a verb (lat. modus verbi). The notion of mood also resembles the various extensions of the logic of facts in modal logic and logic with modalities, where the moodCode specifies the modality (fact, possibility, intention, goal, etc.) under which the Act-statement is judged as appropriate or defective.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>   To illustrate the effect of mood code, consider a "blood glucose" observation:The DEFINITION mood specifies the Act of "obtaining blood glucose". Participations describe in general the characteristics of the people who must be involved in the act, and the required objects, e.g., specimen, facility, equipment, etc. involved. The Observation.value specifies the absolute domain (range) of the observation (e.g., 15-500 mg/dl).In INTENT mood the author of the intent expresses the intent that he or someone else "should obtain blood glucose". The participations are the people actually or supposedly involved in the intended act, especially the author of the intent or any individual assignments for group intents, and the objects actually or supposedly involved in the act (e.g., specimen sent, equipment requirements, etc.). The Observation.value is usually not specified, since the intent is to measure blood glucose, not to measure blood glucose in a specific range. (But compare with GOAL below).In REQUEST mood, a kind of intent, the author requests to "please obtain blood glucose". The Participations are the people actually and supposedly involved in the act, especially the placer and the designated filler, and the objects actually or supposedly involved in the act (e.g., specimen sent, equipment requirements, etc.). The Observation.value is usually not specified, since the order is not to measure blood glucose in a specific range.In EVENT mood, the author states that "blood glucose was obtained". Participations are the people actually involved in the act, and the objects actually involved (e.g., specimen, facilities, equipment). The Observation.value is the value actually obtained (e.g., 80 mg/dL, or &lt;15 mg/dL).In event-CRITERION mood, an author considers a certain class of "obtaining blood glucose" possibly with a certain value (range) as outcome. The Participations constrain the criterion, for instance, to a particular patient. The Observation.value is the range in which the criterion would hold (e.g. &gt; 180 mg/dL or 200-300 mg/dL).In GOAL mood (a kind of criterion), the author states that "our goal is to be able to obtain blood glucose with the given value (range)". The Participations are similar to intents, especially the author of the goal and the patient for whom the goal is made. The Observation.value is the range which defined when the goal is met (e.g. 80-120 mg/dl).</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>A code specifying the particular kind of Act that the Act-instance represents within its class.  Constraints: The kind of Act (e.g. physical examination, serum potassium, inpatient encounter, charge financial transaction, etc.) is specified with a code from one of several, typically external, coding systems. The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc.Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure.Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code "potassium" together with and Act.classCode for "laboratory observation" to somehow mean "potassium laboratory observation" and then use the same Act.code for "potassium" together with Act.classCode for "medication" to mean "substitution of potassium". This mutually modifying use of Act.code and Act.classCode is not permitted.  Discussion: Act.code is not a required attribute of Act. Rather than naming the kind of Act using an Act.code, one can specify the Act using only the class code and other attributes and properties of the Act. In general and more commonly, the kind of Act is readily specified by an ActRelationship specifying that this Act instantiates another Act in definition mood. Or, even without reference to an act definition, the act may be readily described by other attributes, ActRelationships and Participations. For example, the kind of SubstanceAdministration may be readily described by referring to the specific drug, as the Participation of an Entity representing that drug.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>   Used with an Observation event, it allows one to say "patient has NO chest pain". With an Observation criterion it negates the criterion analogously, e.g., "if patient has NO chest pain for 3 days ...", or "if systolic blood pressure is not within 90-100 mm Hg ..."  Discussion: The negationInd works as a negative existence quantifier. This is best explained on Acts in criterion mood, and then translates into all other moods. In criterion mood without negation, one usually only specifies a few critical attributes and relationships (features) of an Act, i.e., only those that are needed to test the criterion. The more features one specifies, the more constrained (specific) is the criterion. For example, to test for "systolic blood pressure of 90-100 mm Hg", one would use only the descriptive attributes Act.code (for systolic blood pressure) and Observation.value (for 90-100 mm Hg). If one would also specify an effectiveTime, i.e., for "yesterday", the criterion would be more constrained. If the negationInd is true for the above criterion, then the meaning of the test is whether a systolic blood pressure of 90-100 mm Hg yesterday does not exist (independent of whether any blood pressure was measured).The negationInd negates the Act as described by the descriptive properties (including Act.code, Act.effectiveTime, Observation.value, Act.doseQty, etc.) and any of its components. The inert properties such as Act.id, Act.moodCode, Act.confidentialityCode, and particularly the Author-Participation are not negated. These inert properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains to be the author of the negative observation. Also, most ActRelationships (except for components) are not included in the negation. For example, a highly confidential order written by Dr. Jones, to explicitly not give "succinyl choline" for the "reason" (ActRelationship) of a history of malignant hyperthermia (Observation) negates the descriptive properties "give succinyl choline" (Act.code), but it is still positively an order and written by Dr. Jones and for patient John Smith, and the reason for this order is the patient's history of malignant hyperthermia. However, additional detail in descriptive attributes will be part of the negation which then limits the effectiveness of the negated statement. For example, had the order not to give a substance included a doseQuantity, it would mean that the substance should not be given at that particular dose (but any other dose might still be O.K.).An act statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the Act. For instance, a negated "finding of wheezing on July 1" means that the author positively denies that there was wheezing on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation. Conversely, negation indicator does not just negate that the fact was affirmed or that the statement had been made. This holds for all moods in the same way, e.g., a negated order is an order not to do the described act, not just the lapidary statement that there is no such order.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>A character string containing a formal language expression that specifies how the Act's attributes are (should be or have been) derived from input parameters associated with derivation relationships.  Discussion: Derived observations can be defined through association with other observations using ActRelationships of type "derivation". For example, to define a derived observation for Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) one will associate the MCH observation with a Hemoglobin (HGB) observation and a Red Blood cell Count (RBC) observation. And the derivation expression encodes the formula: MCH = HGB / RBC.The derivation expression is represented as a character string.[Note: The syntax of that expression is yet to be fully specified. There would be a single standard expression language rather than an optional choice between many expression languages. The syntax would be based on a de-facto standard for many object-oriented languages, such as C++, Java, OCL etc. A concrete specification of this expression language is being worked on now and drafts can be expected within the year 2003.]</mif:text>

CONSTRAINT: Previous to release 2.05 of the RIM, this attribute bore the datatype ST. From release 2.05 onwards, the datatype was extended to a constrained restriction of the ED datatype. The constraints to be imposed are identical to those for the ST datatype, except that the mediaType shall be "text/x-hl7-title+xml" or "text/plain". The intent is to allow sufficient mark-up to convey the semantics of scientific phrases, such as chemical compounds. This markup must not be used to convey simple display preferences. The default mediaType should be "text/plain".  Discussion: This is not a formal identifier but rather a human-recognizable common name. However it is similar to the id attribute in that it refers to a specific Act rather than a 'kind' of act. (For definition mood, the title refers to that specific definition, rather than to a broad category that might be conveyed with Act.code.)

For act orders, the description will contain particular instructions pertaining only to that order. The content of the description is not considered part of the functional information communicated between computer systems. For Acts that involve human readers and performers, however, computer systems must show the Act.text field to a human user, who has responsibility for the activity; or at least must indicate the existence of the Act.text information and allow the user to see that information.Free text descriptions are used to help an individual interpret the content and context of the act, but all information relevant for automated functions must be communicated using the proper attributes and associated objects.  Usage: The intent is that a user can read Act.text alone without seeing any of the encoded information and have no risk of misinterpreting or lacking full understanding of the full content of the Act. For example, II.root, or CD.codeSystem would not normally be displayed to a human and thus would not need to be exposed as part of Act.text.The rendering is expected to include all 'descendant' ActRelationships and Participations recursively navigating child Acts as exposed in that particular 'snapshot'. However, there are several data elements which are NOT expected to be included in the rendering.

Computable information must be conveyed using discrete attributes. Any information which Act.text contains not elsewhere exposed in encoded information will be opaque to computer systems. For this reason, Act.text should not be used to contain information which negates or significantly modifies the understanding of information encoded in discrete attributes.To communicate "supplemental text", an act relationship (e.g. "component" or "subject of") should be created to a separate Act with a bare Act.text attribute should be used to convey the supplemental information, possibly with a code indicating "annotation" or some similar concept.</mif:text>

Design Advisory: This attribute was defined in the original RIM as repeating, owing to the presence of nested states in the state machines. In actual practice, however, there is never a need to communicate more than a single status value. therefore, committees are advised to constrain this attribute to a maximum cardinality of 1 in all message designs. </mif:text>

                     <mif:text>   For clinical Observations, the effectiveTime is the time at which the observation holds (is effective) for the patient.For contracts, the effectiveTime is the time for which the contract is in effect.For consents, the effectiveTime is the time for which the consent is valid.For substance administrations, the effective time is the time over which the substance is to be administered, including the frequency of administration (e.g. TID for 10 days)For a surgical procedure (operation), the effectiveTime is the time relevant for the patient, i.e., between incision and last suture. For transportation acts, the effective time is the time the transported payload is en route.For patient encounters, this is the "administrative" time, i.e., the encounter start and end date required to be chosen by business rules, as opposed to the actual time the healthcare encounter related work is performed.  Discussion: The effectiveTime is also known as the "primary" time (Arden Syntax) or the "biologically relevant time" (HL7 v2.x). This attribute is distinguished from activityTime.For observations, the time of the observation activity may be much later than the time of the observed feature. For instance, in a Blood Gas Analysis (BGA), a result will always come up several minutes after the specimen was taken, meanwhile the patient's physiological state may have changed significantly. For essentially physical activities (surgical procedures, transportations, etc.), the effective time is the time of interest for the Act's intention, i.e., since the intention of a transportation is to deliver a payload from location A to B, the effectiveTime is the time this payload is underway from A to B. However, the Act usually also includes accidental work which is necessary to perform the intention of the Act, but is not relevant for the Act's purpose. For example, the time a driver needs to go to the pick-up location A and then return from drop-off location B to some home base, is included in the physical activity, but does not matter from the perspective of the payload's transportation. Another example is: a person's work hours (effectiveTime) may be from 8 AM to 5 PM, no matter whether that person needs 10 minutes for the commute or 2 hours. The commute is necessary to be at work, but it is not essential for the work hours.</mif:text>

The activityTime includes the times of component actions (such as preparation and clean-up)For Procedures and SubstanceAdministrations, the activityTime can provide a needed administrative / scheduling function by providing a more complete time that needs to be anticipated for particular acts.</xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Discussion: The activityTime is more of administrative rather than clinical use. The clinically relevant time is the effectiveTime. When an observation of a prior symptom is made, the activityTime describes the time the observation is made, as opposed to effectiveTime which is the time the symptom occurred. Thus the activityTime may be entirely different than the effectiveTime of the same Act. But even apart from clinical use cases, designers should first consider effectiveTime as the primary relevant time for an Act.</xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The activityTime is a descriptive attribute, i.e., like effectiveTime, it always describes the Act event as it does or would occur, even when working with different moods. For example, when a procedure is requested, the activityTime describes the requested total time of the procedure. By contrast, the author Participation.time is inert, i.e., author participation time on an order specifies when the order was written and has nothing to do with when the event might actually occur.</xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:p xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ActivityTime indicates when an Act occurs, not when an Act is recorded. Many applications track the time an observation is recorded rather than the precise time during which an observation is made, in which case Participation.time (e.g. of the Author) should be used. These recorded observations can take place during an encounter, and the time of the encounter often provides enough information so that activityTime isn't clinically relevant.</xhtml:p>

                     <mif:text>   An Act might record that a patient had a right-ventricular myocardial infarction effective three hours ago (see Act.effectiveTime), but we may only know about this unusual condition a few minutes ago (Act.availabilityTime). Thus, any interventions from three hours ago until a few minutes ago may have assumed the more common left-ventricular infarction, which can explain why these interventions (e.g., nitrate administration) may not have been appropriate in light of the more recent knowledge.  Discussion: The availabilityTime is a subjective secondary piece of information added (or changed) by a system that reproduces this Act, and is not attributed to the author of the act statement (it would not be included in the material the author would attest to with a signature). The system reproducing the Act is often not the same as the system originating the Act, but a system that received this Act from somewhere else, and, upon receipt of the Act, values the availabilityTime to convey the time since the users of that particular system could have known about this Act-instance.When communicating availabilityTime to another system, the availabilityTime of an Act A is attributed to the author of another Act B, that refers to or includes A. For example, if a medical record extract is compiled for reporting adverse events, availabilityTimes are attributed to the author who compiles that report.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>A code that controls the disclosure of information about this Act, regardless of mood.  Discussion: It is important to note that the necessary confidentiality of the medical record cannot be achieved solely through confidentiality codes to mask individual record items from certain types of users. There are two important problems with per-item confidentiality: one is inference and the other is the danger of holding back information that may be critical in a certain care situation. Inference means that filtered sensitive information can still be assumed given the other information that was not filtered. The simplest form of inference is that even the existence of a test order for an HIV Western Blot test or a T4/T8 lymphocyte count is a strong indication for an existing HIV infection, even if the results are not known. Very often, diagnoses can be inferred from medication, such as Zidovudin for treatment of HIV infections. The problem of hiding individual items becomes especially difficult with current medications, since the continuing administration of the medication must be assured.To mitigate some of the inference-risk, aggregations of data should assume the confidentiality level of the most confidential action in the aggregation.</mif:text>

Discussion:This is not intended for use to replace or compete with uncertainty associated with Observation.value alone or other individual attributes of the class. Such pointed indications of uncertainty should be specified by applying the PPD, UVP or UVN data type extensions to the specific attribute. Particularly if the uncertainty is uncertainty of a quantitative measurement value, this must still be represented by a PPD&lt;PQ&gt; in the value andnotusing the uncertaintyCode. Also, when differential diagnoses are enumerated or weighed for probability, the UVP&lt;CD&gt; or UVN&lt;CD&gt; must be used, not the uncertaintyCode.

                  <mif:text>A directed association between a source Act and a target Act. ActRelationship on the same source Act are called the "outbound" act relationships of that Act. ActRelationships on the same target Act are called the "inbound" relationships of that Act. The meaning and purpose of an ActRelationship is specified in the ActRelationship.typeCode attribute. </mif:text>

                  <mif:text>   1) An electrolyte observation panel may have sodium, potassium, pH, and bicarbonate observations as components. The composite electrolyte panel would then have 4 outbound ActRelationships of type "has component".2) The electrolyte panel event has been performed in fulfillment of an observation order. The electrolyte panel event has an outbound ActRelationship of type "fulfills" with the order as target.3) A Procedure "cholecystectomy" may be performed for the reason of an Observation of "cholelithiasis". The procedure has an outbound ActRelationship of type "has reason" to the cholelithiasis observation.  Discussion: Consider every ActRelationship instance an arrow with a point (headed to the target) and a butt (coming from the source). The functions (sometimes called "roles") that source and target Acts play in that association are defined for each ActRelationship type differently. For instance in a composition relationship, the source is the composite and the target is the component. In a reason-relationship the source is any Act and the target is the reason or indication for the source-Act.The relationships associated with an Act are considered properties of the source act object. This means that the author of an Act-instance is also considered the author of all of the act relationships that have this Act as their source. There are no exceptions to this rule.See ActRelationship.typeCode for more overview of the different kinds of ActRelationships.The ActRelationship class is used to construct action plans and to represent clinical reasoning or judgments about action relationships. Prior actions can be linked as the reasons for more recent actions. Supporting evidence can be linked with current clinical hypotheses. Problem lists and other networks of related judgments about clinical events are represented by the ActRelationship link.One of the most commonly used ActRelationship types is "has component" to describe the composition and de-composition of Acts. The relationship type allows specifying detail of Acts to varying degrees.The composition relationship can group actions into "batteries," e.g., LYTES, CHEM12, or CBC, where multiple routine laboratory tests are ordered as a group. Some groupings, such as CHEM12, appear more arbitrary; others, such as blood pressure, seem to naturally consist of systolic and diastolic pressure.The composition relationships can be arranged in a sequence to form temporal and conditional (non-temporal) action plans (e.g., care plan, critical path, clinical trials protocol, drug treatment protocols). There is a group of attributes in both Act and ActRelationship that we refer to as the "workflow Control suite of attributes", and which allow the detailed specification of executable action plans. These attributes are:ActRelationship.sequenceNumber arranges the components of an Act as a sequence or as concurrent collections of components, expressing logical branches as well as parallel tasks (tasks carried out at the same time). The ActRelationship attributes splitCode and joinCode control how branches are selected or executable in parallel.Act.activityTime and ActRelationship.pauseQty allow one to explicitly time an action plan. Act.repeatNumber allows specifying act to repeat (loop).The ActRelationship type has-precondition allows plan steps to be conditional on the status or outcome of previous actions. The ActRelationhsip.checkpointCode specifies when pre-conditions of acts are tested during the flow of control.The composition ActRelationship allows these constructs to be organized in multiple layers of nesting to fully support workflow management. This nesting and the workflow control attributes are designed in analogy to a block-structured programming language with support for concurrency (fork, join, interrupts), and without "goto" statements. It is important to note that ALL plans are established through sequencing components (steps) in a composite act (block) as can be depicted in "Nassi-Schneiderman" diagrams (also known as "Chap Charts" or "Structograms"), not by chain-linking acts as in a flowchart diagram. With the composition relationship, the detail of Acts can be revealed to different levels for different purposes, without the structure of the Act hierarchy needing to be rearranged. This allows supporting multiple viewpoints on the same business processes. For instance, a billing-viewpoint of a laboratory test battery may be as a single billable act. A clinician's view of the same laboratory test battery is as a set of individual observations, where the ordering among the observations is irrelevant. The laboratory's view of this act will be more detailed, including action plan steps that are never reported to the clinician (e.g., centrifugation, decantation, aliquoting, running certain machines etc.). The laboratory's viewpoint warrants a thorough specification of action plans (that can be automated). During this specification, more and more nested sub-activities will be defined. Still the Act is the same, with varying degrees of detail uncovered in the de-composition relationship. We described the nature of varying detail saying that Acts are "fractal", ever more decomposable, just as the movements of a robotic arm can be decomposed in many fine control steps.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>   In the interest of reducing duplication, humans tend to rely on context when interpreting information. For example, when reading a report taken from a folder containing a patient's medical record, the reader will infer that the report deals with the patient, even if there is no direct reference to the patient on the form. However, other pieces of information such as the author of the folder (the hospital that maintains it) may sometimes apply to the contents of the folder (e.g. a report generated by a doctor at the hospital) and other times not (e.g. a copy of a report from another institution). Humans are quite good at making the necessary inferences about what context should be propagated from an item to something within that item. However, incorrect inferences can occur (perhaps the report in the patient's record deals with a relative). Furthermore, computers have substantially more difficulty making such inferences, even though they can be essential for decision-support systems.  Discussion: This attribute allows the clear specification of whether an association adds to the context associated with a particular item (e.g. adding an additional author) or whether it replaces (overrides) part of the context associated with a particular item (e.g. identifying a sole author, independent of the containing item). It also indicates whether the association applies to only this act (non-propagating), or whether it may apply to derived acts as well (propagating).This attribute is closely linked with ActRelationship.contextConductionInd which determines whether associations that have been marked as propagating will actually be conducted to a child Act. For example, an author participation might be marked as propagating, but still not conducted to a hyperlink to an external document.If no value or default is specified for this attribute (i.e. it is null), no inference can be made about context. Systems must make their own assumptions on the basis of what data is being represented. (For this reason, HL7 committees are encouraged to specify a default or fixed value for this attribute as part of their designs to ensure consistency of interpretation.)</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>   An observation event has a patient participation marked "additive, propagating" (AP) and has component observation events linked through act relationships that are marked propagating. This means that the patient participation behaves as a patient participation of those component observation events in addition to the parent observation event.A composite order is created containing a pharmacy order as well as requests for several lab tests. The composite order has participations for patient and author, and an act relationship to a diagnosis, all marked as "additive, propagating". The "component" association between the composite order and the pharmacy order is marked as conductive (contextConductionInd is TRUE). The pharmacy order has an author participation marked as "additive, non-propagating" (AN), and a reason relationship to a diagnosis, marked as "overriding, propagating" (OP). The order further has a relationship to a dispense event, marked as conductive, and an association to a drug protocol marked as non-conductive (contextConductionInd is FALSE). The meaning would be as follows:The pharmacy order is interpreted as having the patient from the composite order, and having two authors (the one from the composite order, and the one on the pharmacy order itself). The diagnosis for the pharmacy order would only be the diagnosis specified on the pharmacy order, not the one specified on the composite order. The dispense event would carry the patient from the composite order and the diagnosis from the pharmacy order, but no author. The drug protocol would not be associated with a patient, diagnosis or author.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>If true, associations in the parent act are conducted across the ActRelationship to the child act.  Discussion: Only associations that have been added to the context of an Act and are marked "propagating" will be conducted. (See contextControlCode on ActRelationship and Participation)The identification of an Act as a parent or child (and therefore the direction context will be conducted) is determined by how the association is traversed when it is serialized. The first act to be encountered is considered to be the parent. Context conducts across the ActRelationship to the second (child) Act.Refer to ActRelationship.contextControlCode for rationale and examples.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>A code specifying when in the course of an Act a precondition for the Act is evaluated (e.g., before the Act starts for the first time, before every repetition, after each repetition but not before the first, or throughout the entire time of the Act).  Discussion: This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Before each step is executed, those with preconditions have their conditions tested; where the test is positive, the Act has clearance for execution. The repeatNumber may indicate that an Act may be repeatedly executed. The checkpointCode is specifies when the precondition is checked and is analogous to the various conditional statements and loop constructs in programming languages "while-do" vs. "do-while" or "repeat-until" vs. "loop-exit".For all checkpointCodes, except "end", preconditions are being checked at the time when the preceding step of the plan has terminated and this step would be next in the sequence established by the sequenceNumber attribute. When the checkpointCode for a criterion of a repeatable Act is "end", the criterion is tested only at the end of each repetition of that Act. When the condition holds true, the next repetition is ready for execution. When the checkpointCode is "entry" the criterion is checked at the beginning of each repetition (if any) whereas "beginning" means the criterion is checked only once before the repetition "loop" starts.The checkpointCode "through" is special in that it requires the condition to hold throughout the execution of the Act, even throughout a single execution. As soon as the condition turns false, the Act should receive an interrupt event (see Act.interruptibleInd) and will eventually terminate.The checkpointCode "exit" is only used on a special plan step that represents a loop exit step. This allows an action plan to exit due to a condition tested inside the execution of this plan. Such exit criteria are sequenced with the other plan components using the ActRelationship.sequenceNumber.</mif:text>

An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. The splitCode specifies whether a branch is executed exclusively (case-switch) or inclusively, i.e., in parallel with other branches. In addition to exclusive and inclusive split the splitCode specifies how the pre-condition (also known as "guard conditions" on the branch) are evaluated. A guard condition may be evaluated once when the branching step is entered and if the conditions do not hold at that time, the branch is abandoned. Conversely execution of a branch may wait until the guard condition turns true.In exclusive wait branches, the first branch whose guard conditions turn true will be executed and all other branches abandoned. In inclusive wait branches some branches may already be executed while other branches still wait for their guard conditions to turn true.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>A code specifying how concurrent Acts are resynchronized in a parallel branch construct.  Discussion: This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. Branches are parallel if the splitCode specifies that more than one branch can be executed at the same time. The joinCode then specifies if and how the branches are resynchronized.The principal re-synchronization actions are (1) the control flow waits for a branch to terminate (wait-branch), (2) the branch that is not yet terminated is aborted (kill-branch), (3) the branch is not re-synchronized at all and continues in parallel (detached branch).A kill-branch is only executed if there is at least one active wait (or exclusive wait) branch. If there is no other wait branch active, a kill-branch is not started at all (rather than being aborted shortly after it is started). Since a detached branch is unrelated to all other branches, active detached branches do not protect a kill-branch from being aborted.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>   If the relationship without negation specifies that Act A has Act B as a component, then the negation indicator specifies that Act A does not have Act B as a component. If B is a reason for A, then negation means that B is not a reason for A. If B is a pre-condition for A, then negation means that B is not a precondition for A.  Discussion: As the examples show, the use of this attribute is quite limited, notably contrast this with the Act.negationInd that actually requires that the described Act not exist, not be done, etc. whereas the ActRelationship.negationInd merely negates this relationship between source and target act, but does not change the meaning of each Act. This is mostly used for clarifying statements. Note also the difference between negation and the contrary. A contraindication is the contrary of an indication (reason) but not the negation of the reason. The fact that lower back pain is not a reason to prescribe antibiotics doesn't mean that antibiotics are contraindicated with lower back pain.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>A code specifying the logical conjunction of the criteria among all the condition-links of Acts (e.g., and, or, exclusive-or).  Constraints: All AND criteria must be true. If OR and AND criteria occur together, one criterion out of the OR-group must be true and all AND criteria must be true also. If XOR criteria occur together with OR and AND criteria, exactly one of the XOR criteria must be true, and at least one of the OR criteria and all AND criteria must be true. In other words, the sets of AND, OR, and XOR criteria are in turn combined by a logical AND operator (all AND criteria and at least one OR criterion and exactly one XOR criterion). To overcome this ordering, Act criteria can be nested in any way necessary.</mif:text>

                  <mif:text>An association between an Act and a Role with an Entity playing that Role. Each Entity (in a Role) involved in an Act in a certain way is linked to the act by one Participation-instance.

               <mif:rationale>
                  <mif:text>   Participations represent performance while Roles represent competence. Participations specify the actual performance of an Entity in a certain Act, and thus a Participation is scoped by its specific Act. Conversely, Roles specify the competence of an Entity (i.e., how it may principally participate in what kinds of acts) irrespective of any individual Act.For example, the professional credentials of a person (Role) may be quite different from what a person actually does (Participation). A common example is interns and residents performing anesthesia or surgeries under (more or less) supervision of attending specialists. An Act can have multiple participations of the same type, which indicates collaborative activities or group involvement. The notion of multiple performing Participations partially overlaps with sub-activities (Act components). Whenever multiple actors are involved in an act, each actor performs a different task (with the extremely rare exception of such symmetrical activities as two people pulling a rope from either end). Thus, the presence of multiple actors could be equally well represented as an act consisting of sub-acts where each act would have only one performing actor For example, a record of a surgical service may include the actors of type: (a) consenter, (b) primary surgeon, and (c) anesthetist. These three actors really perform different tasks, which can be represented as three related acts: (a) the consent, (b) the surgery proper, and (c) the anesthesia act in parallel to the surgery. If we used the sub-acts, the consenter, surgeon and anesthetist could simply be of actor type "performer." Thus the more sub-acts we use, the fewer different actor types we need to distinguish; conversely, the fewer sub-acts we use, the more distinct actor types we need.As a rule of thumb, sub-tasks should be considered instead of multiple actors when each sub-task requires special scheduling, or billing, or if overall responsibilities for the sub-tasks are different. In most cases, however, human resources are scheduled by teams (instead of individuals), billing tends to lump many sub-tasks together into one position, and overall responsibility often rests with one attending physician, chief nurse, or head of department. This model allows both the multi-actor and the multi-act approach to represent the business reality, with a slight bias towards "lumping" minor sub-activities into the overall act.</mif:text>

Discussion: This code can accommodate the huge variety and nuances of functions that participants may perform in the act. The number and kinds of functions applicable depends on the special kind of act. E.g., each operation and method may require a different number of assistant surgeons or nurses.Since participation functions refer to what people do in an Act, these are really sub-activities that may all occur in parallel. If any more detail needs to be said about these activities other than just who does them, one should consider using component acts instead.</mif:text>

                  <mif:text>An act representing a change to the state of another class, a user event (e.g. query), or a system event (e.g. time-based occurrences).    Examples:         Discharging a patient (Encounter from Active to Completed);      Stopping a medication (SubstanceAdministration from Active to Aborted);       Sending an end-of-day summary (time-based event).        Discussion: This class corresponds to the concept of 'Trigger Event', and as such, must be present as the focus of every messaging interaction (because of the 1..1 association between a trigger event and an interaction.) However, control acts can also appear within a message payload. For example, a set of control acts associated with a Lab Order identifying the events that have occurred against that order (first created, then revised, then suspended, then resumed, then completed.)</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>   Some parameters for tasks are uniquely defined by a specific model of equipment. Most critical arguments of a task (e.g., container to operate on, positioning, timing, etc.) are specified in an HL7 standardized structure, and the parameter list would not be used for those. The parameter list is used only for those parameters that cannot be standardized because they are uniquely defined for a specific model of equipment. NOTE: This means that the semantics and interpretation of a parameterValue can only be made with an understanding of the specifications or documentation for the specific device being addressed. This information is not conveyed as part of the message.  Constraints: Parameters are only specified here if they are not included in a separate HL7 defined structure. The parameters are a list of any data values interpreted by the device. The parameters should be typed with an appropriate HL7 data type (e.g., codes for nominal settings, such as flags, REAL and INT for numbers, TS for points in time, PQ for dimensioned quantities, etc.). However, besides this HL7 data typing, the functioning of the parameters is opaque to the HL7 standardization.</mif:text>

                  <mif:text>   Exposure is an interaction that provides opportunity for transmission of an agent from an exposure source entity to an exposure target entity. The agent is a physical (including energy), chemical or biological substance. (Note: This class deals only with opportunity and not the outcome of the exposure, i.e. not all exposed parties will necessarily acquire the agent nor will all who acquire the agent necessarily experience actual harm or benefit.)  Relationship to Substance Administration: There is a relationship between Exposure and Substance Administration. Normally when an entity has been exposed to an agent, and it is known the agent has affected the entity (e.g., caused a disease), then it is logically understood that the agent was introduced into the entity in some fashion. Commonly, an agent is introduced via a Substance Administration of some sort. In those instances, there is an act relationship (COMP where Exposure is the source act) between the Exposure and the Substance Administration. Alternately, when a physician writes a prescription for a drug for a patient, the physician is effectively ordering the patient be exposed to a particular substance in the prescribed fashion (i.e., a specific type of substance administration). However, this type of administration of the prescribed substance, while normally documented as a Substance Administration, is not typically documented with a related &#147;Exposure&#148; due to the detailed knowledge of cause and effect.</mif:text>

               <mif:otherAnnotation type="examples" name="examples">
                  <mif:text>  The following examples are provided to indicate what interactions are considered exposures vs. other types of Acts:  A patient accidentally receives three times the recommended dose of their medication due to a dosing error.   There is a substance administration. Public health and/or safety authorities may also be interested in documenting this with an associated exposure.      A patient accidentally is dispensed an incorrect medicine (clomiphene instead of clomipramine). They have taken several doses before the mistake is detected. They are therefore &#147;exposed&#148; to a medicine that there was no therapeutic indication for them to receive.   There are several substance administrations. Public health and/or safety authorities may also be interested in documenting this with associated exposures.      In a busy medical ward, a patient is receiving chemotherapy for a lymphoma. Unfortunately, the IV infusion bag containing the medicine splits, spraying cytotoxic medication over the patient being treated and the patient in the adjacent bed.   There are three substance administrations. The first is the intended one (IV infusion) with its associated (implicit) exposure. There is an incident with an associated substance administration to the same patient involving the medication sprayed over the patient as well as an associated exposure. Additionally, the incident includes a substance administration involving the spraying of medication on the adjacent patient, also with an associated exposure.      A patient who is a refugee from a war-torn African nation arrives in a busy inner city A&amp;E department suffering from a cough with bloody sputum. Not understanding the registration and triage process, they sit in the waiting room for several hours before it is noticed that they have not booked in. As soon as they are being processed, it is suspected that they are suffering from TB. Vulnerable (immunosuppressed) patients who were sharing the waiting room with this patient may have been exposed to the tubercule bacillus, and must be traced for investigation.   There is an exposure (or possibly multiple exposures) in the waiting room involving the refugee and everyone else in the waiting room during the period. There might also be a number of known or presumed substance administrations (coughing) via several possible routes. The substance administrations are only hypotheses until confirmed by further testing.      A patient who has received an elective total hip replacement procedure suffers a prolonged stay in hospital, due to contracting an MRSA infection in the surgical wound site after the surgery.   There was an exposure to MRSA. Although there was some sort of substance administration, it&#146;s possible the exact mechanism for introduction of the MRSA into the wound will not be identified.      Routine maintenance of the X-ray machines at a local hospital reveals a serious breach of the shielding on one of the machines. Patients who have undergone investigations using that machine in the last month are likely to have been exposed to significantly higher doses of X-rays than was intended, and must be tracked for possible adverse effects.   There has been an exposure of each patient who used the machine in the past 30 days.      A new member of staff is employed in the laundry processing room of a small cottage hospital, and a misreading of the instructions for adding detergents results in fifty times the usual concentration of cleaning materials being added to a batch of hospital bedding. As a result, several patients have been exposed to very high levels of detergents still present in the &#147;clean&#148; bedding, and have experienced dermatological reactions to this.   There has been an incident with multiple exposures to several patients. Although there are substance administrations involving the application of the detergent to the skin of the patients, it is expected that the substance administrations would not be directly documented.      Seven patients who are resident in a facility for the care of the elderly mentally ill have developed respiratory problems. After several months, during which various tests are performed and various medications prescribed to the patients, the problem is traced to their being &#147;sensitive&#148; to a new fungicide which has been used in the plaster of the walls of the ward they are patients on.   The patients have been continuously exposed to the fungicide. Although there have been continuous substance administrations (via breathing) this would not normally be documented as a substance administration.      A patient with osteoarthritis of the knees is treated symptomatically using analgesia, paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1g up to four times a day for pain relief. His GP does not realize that the patient has, 20 years previously (whilst at college) had severe alcohol addiction problems, and now, although this is completely under control, his liver has suffered significantly, leaving him more sensitive to hepatic toxicity from paracetamol use. Later that year, the patient returns with a noticeable level of jaundice. Paracetamol is immediately withdrawn and alternative solutions for the knee pain are sought. The jaundice gradually subsides with conservative management, but referral to the gastroenterologist is required for advice and monitoring.   There is a substance administration with an associated exposure. The exposure component is based on the relative toxic level of the substance to a patient with a compromised liver function.      A patient goes to their GP complaining of abdominal pain, having been discharged from the local hospital ten days&#146; previously after an emergency appendectomy. The GP can find nothing particularly amiss, and presumes it is post operative surgical pain that will resolve. The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment. At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass. A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patient&#146;s abdominal cavity. Thankfully, a full recovery then takes place.   This is a procedural sequelae. There may be an Incident recorded for this also.      A patient is slightly late for their regular pacemaker battery check in the Cardiology department of the local hospital. They are hurrying down the second floor corridor. A sudden summer squall has recently passed over the area, and rain has come in through an open corridor window leaving a small puddle on the corridor floor. In their haste, the patient slips in the puddle and falls so badly that they have to be taken to the A&amp;E department, where it is discovered on investigation they have slightly torn the cruciate ligament in their left knee.   This is not an exposure. There has been an incident.         Interpretation of Exposure.statusCode: The Exposure.statusCode attribute should be interpreted as the state of the Exposure business object (e.g., active, aborted, completed) and not the &#147;clinical&#148; status of the exposure (e.g., probable, confirmed). The &#147;clinical&#148; status of the exposure would be associated with the exposure via a subject observation.  Constraints: The following participations should be used with the following participations to distinguish the specific entities:  The exposed entity is the entity of interest that is the recipient of the exposure and potentially affected. This is conveyed through the "exposure target" (EXPTRGT) participation.  An entity that has carried the agent transmitted in the exposure is the "exposure source" (EXSRC). For example:   a person or animal who carried an infectious disease and interacts (EXSRC) with another person or animal (EXPTRGT) transmitting the disease agent;  a place or other environment (EXSRC) and a person or animal (EXPTRGT) who is exposed in the presence of this environment.      When it is unknown whether a participating entity is the source of the agent (EXSRC) or the target of the transmission (EXPTRGT), the "exposure participant" (EXPART) is used.  The physical (including energy), chemical or biological substance which is participating in the exposure uses the &#147;exposure agent&#148; (EXPAGNT) participation. There are at least three configurations:  the player of the Role that participates as EXPAGNT is the chemical or biological substance mixed or carried by the scoper-entity of the Role (e.g., ingredient role); or    the player of the Role that participates as EXPAGNT is a mixture known to contain the chemical, radiological or biological substance of interest; or    the player of the Role that participates as a EXPAGNT is known to carry the agent (i.e., the player is a fomite, vector, etc.).      </mif:text>

                     <mif:text>The the physiological path or route for introducing the therapeutic material into or onto the subject.  Discussion: If the route requires further specification, both the site of administration (administrationSiteCode) and the method of adminitration (methodCode) may be used. For example, if the routeCode is intravenous or intra-muscular, it may be necessary to specify the precise site, with approachSiteCode, (e.g., right forearm or left deltoid muscle respectively) and the precise method of administration, with methodCode, (e.g., "slow bolus injection" or "Z-track injection" respectively).Route, site of administration (administrationSiteCode), method of adminitration (methodCode) and the device used in administration are closely related. All four (if present) must be closely coordinated and in agreement. In some cases, the coding system used to specify one may pre-coordinate one or more of the others.When the medication is delivered to an environmental site, or a location, the route code indicates a site on its "body".</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>   4 hours, 4 mg, 4 boxes, and 15 each of a container of 1000 each, etc.  Discussion: Each InvoiceElement that is being charged or billed is identified by a charge or bill code (InvoiceElement.code). In some situations, this code is a pre-coordinated code set and represents a container (e.g. UPC code for a container of 1000 pills and another UPC code for a container of the same pills but in a container of 100). The UPC code is used in invoicing, but ratios are required to specify that only a portion of the container (e.g. bottle) is being billed or charged. If the InvoiceElement does not reference a container, then the denominator is not specified.For example, 15 pills in a container size of 1000 pills. In this case, the numerator can be expressed as "15 {pill}" or simply "15" and the denominator can be expressed as "1000 {bottle}" or simply "1000" (see discussion following for rationale of using descriptive text for countable units).  Constraints:  The unit of measure is restricted to a measurable unit such as liters, milligrams and hours. Non-measurable, but countable units such as boxes, packages, visits, pills and containers must not be specified using the unit component of the PQ data type, except as an annotation, marked by {xxx}. Refer to Data Types Part II Unabridged Specification, Appendix A :Unified Code for Units of Measure.Specification of countable units can be handled with the following techniques:(1) specify the countable unit in the InvoiceElement.code. That is, a specific InvoiceElement.code would indicate that the item referenced by the act represents a box of 20 items. There would be a different InvoiceElement.code for a box of 40 items, and so on.For example, if the InvoiceElement.code represents a box of 20 items, and the InvoiceElement.unitQuantity = 2 (no units), then this represents 2 boxes of 20 items for a total of 40 items.(2) If more detail is required (e.g. to describe the composition, packaging, manufacturer of a product), then use a participation (typeCode = "PRD"), and a combination of role and entity classes to describe the details of the packaging.</mif:text>

Discussion: This is commonly used in systems where services provided are assigned a relative 'cost or difficulty rating', and then a fixed price is assigned to a 'point'. Adjustments to all prices charged by an organization can then be handled by increasing or decreasing the cost per point to reflect changes in inflation, overhead, etc.The simplest formula for deriving gross amounts is: unitQuantity * unitPriceAmount = netAmt.The concept of Points allows for assignment of point values for services and/or goods, such that a dollar amount can be assigned to each point.

In general, when the sub-activity realized by a Participation is of closer interest and needs to be managed, one SHOULD instead model that sub-activity as an Act component underneath the main Act.However, in certain environments the view of what these activities really are that the participants perform is not very well recognized and hence modeling those as sub-acts is deemed confusing or burdensome.Therefore, the ManagedParticipation extends Participation with an identity-attribute and a state-attribute to support these exceptional use cases.

               <mif:definition>
                  <mif:text>An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The code attribute of Observation and the value attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.  Discussion: Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a "variable" (a named feature that can assume a value); hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter. As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed ("results" or "answers"); and those "results" or "answers" are part of the observation and not split off into other objects. The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations. Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC. Clinical documents commonly have 'Subjective' and 'Objective' findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain 'Assessments', which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation. Examples of Observation:  Recording the results of a Family History Assessment  Laboratory test and associated result  Physical exam test and associated result  Device temperature  Soil lead level  An assertion of a clinical finding, such as left femur fracture  </mif:text>

                     <mif:text>Information that is assigned or determined by the observation action.   Constraints: The Observation.value, if not otherwise constrained, can be of any data type.The appropriate data type of the Observation.value varies with the kind of Observation and can generally be described in Observation definitions or in a simple relation that pairs Act.codes to value data types.The following guidelines govern the choice of the appropriate value data type.(1) Quantitative measurements use the data type Physical Quantity (PQ) in general. A PQ is essentially a real number with a unit. This is the general preference for all numeric values, subject to a few exceptions listed below. Numeric values must not be communicated as simply a character string (ST). (2) Titer (e.g., 1:64) and very few other ratios use the data type Ratio (RTO). For titers, the ratio would be a ratio of two integer numbers (e.g., 1:128). Other ratios may relate different quantitative data types, such as a "price" specified in Physical Quantity over Monetary Amount.Sometimes by local conventions titers are reported as just the denominator (e.g., 32 instead of 1/32). Such conventions are confusing and should be converted into correct ratios in HL7 messages. (3) Index values (a number without unit) uses the Real Number (REAL) data type. When a quantity does not have a proper unit, one can just send the number as a real number. Alternatively one can use a PQ with a dimensionless unit (e.g., 1 or %). An integer number should only be sent when the measurement is by definition an integer, which is an extremely rare case and then is most likely an ordinal (see below).(4) Ranges (e.g., &lt;3; 12-20) must be expressed as Interval of Physical Quantity (IVL&lt;PQ&gt;) or intervals of other quantity data types.Sometimes such intervals are used to report the uncertainty of measurement value. For uncertainty there are dedicated data type extensions available. (5) Ordinals (e.g., +, ++, +++; or I, IIa, IIb, III, IV) use the Coded Ordinal (CO) data type. (6) Nominal results ("taxons", e.g., organism type). use any of the coded data types (CD, CE) that specify at least a code and a coding system, and optionally original text, translations to other coding systems and sometimes qualifiers. (7) Imaging results use the Encapsulated Data (ED) type. The encapsulated data type allows one to send an image (e.g., chest X-ray) or a movie (e.g., coronary angiography, cardiac echo) as alternatively inline binary data or as a reference to an external address where the data can be downloaded on demand.(8) Waveforms can be sent using the Correlated Observation Sequences templates that provide all the data in an HL7 framework. In addition one can use the Encapsulated Data (ED) data type to send waveforms in other than HL7 formats or to refer to waveform data for on-demand download. (9) The character string data type may exceptionally be used to convey formalized expressions that do not fit in any of the existing data types. However, the string data type must not be used if the meaning can be represented by one of the existing data types. (10) Timestamps should not be sent in Observations if there are more appropriate places to send those, e.g., usually as Act.effectiveTime of some act. (E.g., "specimen received in lab" is in the effectiveTime of an Act describing the specimen transport to the lab, not in an Observation.(11) Sets of values of any data type, enumerated sets as well as intervals, are often used for Observation criteria (event-criterion mood) to specify "normal ranges" or "decision ranges" (for alerts) etc.(12) For sequences of observations (repeated measurements of the same property during a relatively short time) a Sequence (LIST) data type is used. Refer to the Correlated Observation Sequences specification for more detail.(13) Uncertainty of values is specified using the Probability and Probability Distribution data type extensions (UVP, PPD). If a statistical sample is reported with absolute frequencies of categories a Bag collection (BAG) can be used efficiently.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>   Blood pressure measurement method: arterial puncture vs. sphygmomanometer (Riva-Rocci), sitting vs. supine position, etc.   Constraints: In all observations the method is already partially specified by the Act.code. In this case, the methodCode need not be used at all. The methodCode may still be used to identify this method more clearly in addition to what is implied from the Act.code. However, an information consumer system or process should not depend on this methodCode information for method detail that is implied by the Act.code. If the methodCode is used to express method detail that is also implied by the Act.code, the methodCode must not be in conflict with the implied method of the Act.code.  Discussion: In all observations the method is already partially specified by simply knowing the kind of observation (observation definition, Act.code) and this implicit information about the method does not need to be specified in Observation.methodCode. For example, many LOINC codes are defined for specific methods as long as the method makes a practical difference in interpretation. Thus, using LOINC, the difference between susceptibility studies using the "minimal inhibitory concentration" (MIC) or the "agar diffusion method" (Kirby-Baur) are specifically assigned different codes. The methodCode therefore is only an additional qualifier to specify what may not be known already from the Act.code.Also, some variances in methods may be tied to the particular device used. The methodCode should not be used to identify the specific device or test-kit material used in the observation. Such information about devices or test-kits should be associated with the observation as "device" participations.</mif:text>

Discussion: Most observation target sites are implied by the observation definition and Act.code, or Observation.value. For example, "heart murmur" always has the heart as target. This attribute is used only when the observation target site needs to be refined, to distinguish right and left etc. If the subject of the Observation is something other than a human patient or animal, the attribute is used analogously to specify a structural landmark of the thing where the act focuses.

                  <mif:text>   Procedures may involve the disruption of some body surface (e.g. an incision in a surgical procedure) conservative procedures such as reduction of a luxated join, including physiotherapy such as chiropractic treatment, massage, balneotherapy, acupuncture, shiatsu, etc. Outside of clinical medicine, procedures may be such things as alteration of environments (e.g. straightening rivers, draining swamps, building dams) or the repair or change of machinery etc.  Discussion: Applied to clinical medicine, procedure is but one among several types of clinical activities such as observation, substance-administrations, and communicative interactions (e.g. teaching, advice, psychotherapy, represented simply as Acts without special attributes). Procedure does not subsume those other activities nor is procedure subsumed by them. Notably Procedure does not comprise all acts of whose intent is intervention or treatment. Whether the bodily alteration is appreciated or intended as beneficial to the subject is likewise irrelevant, what counts is that the act is essentially an alteration of the physical condition of the subject.The choice between representations for real activities is based on whether the specific properties of procedure are applicable and whether the activity or activity step's necessary post-condition is the physical alteration. For example, taking an x-ray image may sometimes be called "procedure", but it is not a Procedure in the RIM sense for an x-ray image is not done to alter the physical condition of the body.Many clinical activities combine Acts of Observation and Procedure nature into one composite. For instance, interventional radiology (e.g., catheter directed thrombolysis) does both observing and treating, and most surgical procedures include conscious and documented Observation steps. These clinical activities therefore are best represented by multiple component acts each of the appropriate type.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>Identifies the means or technique used to perform the procedure.  Discussion: For any Procedure there may be several different methods to achieve by and large the same result, but may be important to know when interpreting a report more thoroughly (e.g., cholecystectomy: open vs. laparoscopic). Method concepts can be "pre-coordinated" in the Act definition. There are many possible methods, which all depend heavily on the particular kind of Procedure, so that defining a vocabulary domain of all methods is difficult. However, a code system might be designed such that it specifies a set of available methods for each defined Procedure concept. Thus, a user ordering a Procedure could select one of several variances of the act by means of the method code. Available method variances may also be defined in a master service catalog for each defined Procedure. In act definition records (Act.moodCode = DEF) the methodCode attribute is a set of all available method codes that a user may select while ordering, or expect while receiving results.</mif:text>

Typically it involves an instance or instances of a reportable infectious disease or other condition. The public health case can include a health-related event concerning a single individual or it may refer to multiple health-related events that are occurrences of the same disease or condition of interest to public health. An outbreak involving multiple individuals may be considered as a type of public health case. A public health case definition (Act.moodCode = "definition") includes the description of the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic indicators associated with a disease or condition of interest to public health. There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not. There are also case definitions for outbreaks. A public health case definition is a construct used by public health for the purpose of counting cases, and should not be used as clinical indications for treatment. Examples include AIDS, toxic-shock syndrome, and salmonellosis and their associated indicators that are used to define a case.</xhtml:p>

Discussion: The substance administered by a performer physically interacts with the subject or is otherwise "taken in" by the subject during the act of administration indicated by the participation consumable.Detailed information about the supplied substance is represented using the entity class or one of its subtypes.The performer of a substance administration may be another entity such as a person, device, plant, e.g. poison ivy, animal, e.g. mosquito bite, or may be the same entity as the subject, as in self-administration.For purposes of this definition, photons and other models of radiation or light energy are considered substances.Substances may also include living entities such as live virus vaccines and other infectious materials containing infectious agents, e.g. saliva, blood products, etc. (Note: if the infectious agent is the subject of the substance administration, then the infectious agent is modeled as a "Living Subject.")In the intent moods, substance administration represents the plan to apply a given material. This includes (but is not limited to) prescriptions in which it might also be associated with a request for supply.In event mood, substance administration represents a record of the actual application of a substance.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>The amount of the therapeutic agent or other substance given at one administration event.  Discussion: The dose may be specified either as a physical quantity of active ingredient (e.g. 200 mg) or as the count of administration-units (e.g., tablets, capsules, "eaches"). Which approach is chosen depends upon the player of the 'consumable' participation (which identifies the drug being administered). If the consumable has a non-countable dosage form (e.g. measured in milligram or litre) then the dose must be expressed in those units. If the consumable has a countable dosage form (tablets, capsules, "eaches"), then the dose must be expressed as a dimensionless count (i.e., with no other unit of measure specified).The unit of measure is restricted to a measurable unit such as milliliters and milligrams. Non-measurable, but countable units such as tablets and capsules must not be specified using the unit component of the PQ data type, except as an annotation, marked by {xxx}.

Multiple occurrences of maxDoseQuantity may be used to indicate different limits over different time periods.</mif:text>

With general Supply Acts, the precise identification of the Material (manufacturer, serial numbers, etc.) is important. Most of the detailed information about the Supply should be represented using the Material class. If delivery needs to be scheduled, tracked, and billed separately, one can associate a Transportation Act with the Supply Act. Pharmacy dispense services are represented as Supply Acts, associated with a SubstanceAdministration Act.

An example is the CDC vaccine manufacturer code, modeled as a concept vocabulary, when in fact each concept refers to a single instance.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>   With undetermined kinds, the quantity is but a reference quantity for the specification of the proportion of ingredients or components (e.g. through a has-part, has-ingredient, or has-content Role). For example, a kind of group with 60% females is Person(quantity = 100) has-part Person(quantity = 60; sex = female). Amoxicillin 500 mg per tablet is Material(Tablet, quantity = 1) has-ingredient Material(Amoxicillin, quantity = 500 mg). Glucose 5% (D5W) is Material(D5W, quantity = 1 kg) has-ingredient Material(Glucose, quantity = 50 g).Material-specific quantity relations are expressed using the fact that the data type of this attribute is a set of physical quantity (SET&lt;PQ&gt;). If more than one quantity value are specified in this set, each element in this set is considered to specify the same amount of the material. For example, for one liter of water one could use the set 1 L, 1 kg, 55.56 mol to specify the volume, mass, and amount of substance for the same amount of water, this is equivalent with specifying the mass density (volumic mass 1 kg/L) and the molar mass (18 g/mol). For Glucose one could specify 180 g, 1 mol according to the molar mass (180 g/mol).  Discussion: When the Entity instance is a portion of a substance, the quantity specifies the amount of that substance comprised by that portion. For an undetermined substance (kind) the quantity serves two purposes at the same time: (a) it provides a means of relations between quantities specific for that substance, and (b) it is a reference quantity for the specification of ingredients or components. In all cases, the quantity is an extensive "amount" kind of quantity (e.g., number, length, volume, mass, surface area, energy, etc.). Note that most relative or fractional quantities are not amounts, in particular, mass fraction, substance concentration, mass ratios, percentages, etc. are not extensive quantities and are prohibited values for this attribute.  Constraints: For Entities with determinerCode = INSTANCE, the quantity is 1. For an Entity with determinerCode = QUANTIFIED_KIND, the quantity is the number of individual members in the group; for an Entity with a determinerCode = KIND, the value is undetermined.</mif:text>

Many of the attribute definitions are drawn from or reference the NCCLS standard. With amorphic substances (liquids, gases) a container is required. However, the content of a container is always distinguishable and relatively easily separable from the container, unlike the content (ingredient) of a mixture.  Usage: A container is related to a content material through Role.classCode = CONT (content).</mif:text>

Discussion: If a kind of material is described (determinerCode = KIND) only the width of that interval can be known, i.e., the duration after opening the reagent container at which the reagent substance is considered useable for its normal testing purpose. For an actual instance of the reagent (e.g., a specific bottle), the stabilityTime.low TS marks the time at which the reagent bottle has been opened (or the reagent was otherwise activated). Together with the typical stability duration, this determines the stabilityTime.high TS beyond which the reagent is no longer considered useable for its normal testing purpose.</mif:text>

                  <mif:text>A competency of the Entity playing the Role as identified, defined, guaranteed, or acknowledged by the Entity that scopes the Role.  Discussion: An Entity participates in an Act as in a particular Role. Note that a particular entity in a particular role can participate in an act in many ways. Thus, a Person in the role of a practitioner can participate in a patient encounter as a rounding physician or as an attending physician. The Role defines the competency of the Entity irrespective of any Act, as opposed to Participation, which are limited to the scope of an Act.Each role is "played" by one Entity, called the "player" and is "scoped" by another Entity, called the "scoper". Thus the Role of "patient" may be played by a person and scoped by the provider organization from which the patient will receive services. Similarly, the employer scopes an "employee" role.The identifier of the Role identifies the Entity playing the role in that role. This identifier is assigned by the scoping Entity to the player. The scoping Entity need not have issued the identifier, but it may have re-used an existing identifier for the Entity to also identify the Entity in the Role with the scoper.Most attributes of Role are attributes of the playing entity while in the particular role.</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>A code that controls the disclosure of information about this Role with respect to the playing Entity..  Discussion: It is important to note that the necessary confidentiality of the medical record cannot be achieved solely through confidentiality codes to mask individual record items from certain types of users. There are two important problems with per-item confidentiality: one is inference and the other is the danger of holding back information that may be critical in a certain care situation. Inference means that filtered sensitive information can still be assumed given the other information that was not filtered. The simplest form of inference is that even the existence of a test order for an HIV Western Blot test or a T4/T8 lymphocyte count is a strong indication for an existing HIV infection, even if the results are not known. Very often, diagnoses can be inferred from medication, such as Zidovudin for treatment of HIV infections. The problem of hiding individual items becomes especially difficult with current medications, since the continuing administration of the medication must be assured.To mitigate some of the inference-risk, aggregations of data should assume the confidentiality level of the most confidential action in the aggregation.</mif:text>

Discussion: In composition-relationships (e.g., has-parts, has-ingredient, has-content) the Role.quantity attribute specifies that a numerator amount of the target entity is comprised by a denominator amount of the source entity of such composition-relationship. For example, if a box (source) has-content 10 eggs (target), the relationship quantity is 10:1; if 0.6 mL contain 75 mg of FeSO4 the ingredient relationship quantity is 75 mg : 0.6 mL. Both numerator and denominator must be amount quantities (extensive quantities, i.e., a count number, mass, volume, amount of substance, amount of energy, etc.).</mif:text>

                     <mif:text>An integer specifying the position of the Entity playing the Role with respect to the Entity that scopes the Role.  Discussion: This attribute is primarily used with respect to containment roles. For example, some containers have discrete positions in which content may be located. Depending on the geometry of the container, the position may be referenced as a scalar ordinal number, or as a vector of ordinal numbers (coordinates). Coordinates always begin counting at 1.Some containers may have customary ways of referring to the positions or no way at all. In the absence of any specific regulation for a specific container type, the rule of thumb is that the coordinate that is changed earlier is positioned first. For an automated blood chemistry analyzer with a square shaped tray, this means that the first coordinate is the one in which direction the tray moves at each step and the second coordinate is the one in which the tray moves only every 10 (or so) steps.</mif:text>

                  <mif:text>A role played by a device when the device is used to administer therapeutic agents (medication and vital elements) into the body, or to drain material (e.g., exudates, pus, urine, air, blood) out of the body.  Discussion: In general, Access is a Role of a ManufacturedMaterial or Device, something specifically manufactured or created to serve that purpose, such as a catheter or cannula inserted into a compartment of the body. Devices in the role of an Access are typically used in intake/outflow observations, and in medication routing instructions. Microbiologic observations on the material itself or on fluids coming out of a drain, are also common.</mif:text>
               </mif:definition>
               <mif:rationale>
                  <mif:text>   The Access role primarily exists in order to describe material actually deployed as an access, and not so much the fresh material as it comes from the manufacturer. For example, in supply ordering a box of catheters from a distributor, it is not necessary to use the Access role class, since the material attributes will usually suffice to describe and identify the product for the order. But the Access role is used to communicate about the maintenance, intake/outflow, and due replacement of tubes and drains.</mif:text>
